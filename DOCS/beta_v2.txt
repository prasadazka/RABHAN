RABHAN "Business/Technical" Proposed Requirements "Beta Version"
RABHAN Project Main Scope: Development of a Fintech BNPL Platform for Solar Energy Financing
RABHAN Location: Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (Platform should support bilingual use: Arabic and English).
RABHAN Overview: The objective is to develop a web and mobile platform that allows users & vendors to demand and supply solar energy solution suitable to their requirement.
The platform will include three primary user groups:
· End Users (homeowners or businesses/industrial owners seeking solar solutions) · Solar vendors (approved contractors and equipment supplier who submit quotations,
supply products and/or complete installation) · Admin & Internal Teams (Managing entire system, loan management, contractor
approval, end user support)
End Users
1. Browse the platform for solar systems via Solar vendor/contractor's portal. 2. Asses their current energy consumption and predict the savings through the Solar
Calculator in the platform. 3. Browse other needed devices and accessories related to solar system via vendors
portal. 4. Receive quotations from approved solar contractors in the same geographical
location. 5. Apply for BNPL financing to install solar energy systems based on their selected
contractor/products. 6. Track their loan processing and approve energy network installation. 7. Make monthly payments through payment getaways and monitor the new energy
system performance.
Vendors (Contractors)
1. Show and present their products and services through the platform with the geographical area they can cover.
2. Receive the quotation request from the users detailing current consumption, exact location, free area for solar network installation and format quotations for them up on.
3. Schedule inspection, installing and maintenance visits with the users through the platform.
4. Once quotation approved, Upload contract and request for loan approval repayment schedule.
5. Issue VAT invoices to the platform minus the platform commission. 6. Create wallets on the platform and follow up their claims.
